# Comments

This projects was developed for the Natural Cycles Frontend Challenge.
What could be improved here is validation of user input, especially for the date picker. The color contrast is not WCAG-compliant. I would prefer not having to use setTimeout for the text-fit solution. If this was a larger project, I would also extract functionalities into smaller, reusable components.
